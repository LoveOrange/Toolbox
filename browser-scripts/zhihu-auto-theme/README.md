This is a user script that automatically toggles Zhihu's light/dark mode to match your system's color scheme preference. Say goodbye to manual theme switching and enjoy a seamless browsing experience that's easy on your eyes, day or night.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Automatic Theme Switching**: Syncs with your system's light or dark mode instantly.
-   **Seamless Integration**: Works quietly in the background for a hassle-free experience.
-   **Lightweight & Efficient**: Minimal performance impact, designed to be lean and fast.
-   **Instant Start**: Runs at `document-start` to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC).
