Welcome to my personal toolbox! This repository is a curated collection of scripts, configurations, and utilities that I've developed to streamline my workflow, enhance my productivity, and solve everyday challenges.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This toolbox is organized into several categories, each serving a unique purpose:

-   **`/browser-scripts`**: A collection of user scripts to enhance web browsing experiences.
    -   **Zhihu Auto Theme Sync**: Automatically syncs Zhihu's theme with your system's light/dark mode.
-   **`/dev-efficiency`**: Tools and scripts focused on improving development efficiency.
-   **`/finance-quant`**: Scripts and notebooks for financial analysis and quantitative trading.
-   **`/ai-vibe`**: Explorations and projects in the realm of Artificial Intelligence.

## 💡 Philosophy

The items in this toolbox are born from a simple philosophy: if a task is repetitive, automate it; if a workflow is clunky, refine it. Everything here is designed to be practical, efficient, and easy to use.

## 🤝 Contribution
